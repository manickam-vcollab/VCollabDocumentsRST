Projection Type
==================

This option switches projection type between Perspective and          
Orthogonal projections.                                               

**Perspective Projection**
                                    
                                                                          
       When the human eye looks at a scene, objects in the distance       
       appear smaller than objects close by  - this is known as           
       perspective. This type is default one for VCollab.                 
                                                                          
**Orthographic Projection**
                                    
                                                                          
       Orthographic projection ignores this effect and represents three   
       dimensional objects in two dimensions. It is a form of parallel    
       projection where all projection lines are orthogonal to the        
       projection plane.

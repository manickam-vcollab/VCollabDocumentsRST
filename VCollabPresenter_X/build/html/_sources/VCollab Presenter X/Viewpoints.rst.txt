Viewpoints
==========

    VCollab Pro has an option for creating viewpoints. The first user     
    defined viewpoint will be the default viewpoint, when the model is    
    loaded. User can export and import vpt files. vpt file consists of    
    all viewpoints of a user specified viewpath. Extension of vpt files   
    is .vpt

Add Viewpoint...                  Adds current view to current path.

Rename Viewpoint...               Allows user to rename the current viewpoint.

Insert Viewpoint...               Inserts a new viewpoint just below the current viewpoint.

Delete Viewpoint                  Deletes selected/current viewpoint.

Update Viewpoint                  Updates selected/current viewpoint with current scene states.

Capture Camera                    Captures current camera properties and save it as a viewpoint. Other states  will not be stored and applied.

Copy / Paste Viewpoints           Allows user to copy viewpoints from one viewpath to another viewpath.

Add Path                          Adds new viewpath.

Rename path                       Allows user to rename the viewpath.

Delete path                       Deletes current path.

Export                            Exports all viewpoints into PPT slides / VPT file/wCAX / 3D HTML File. VPT file can be imported later for relevant CAX file. wCAX can be viewed in web browser

Import Viewpoints...              Imports viewpoints from external vpt or cax file.

Edit Mode                         Selecting a viewpoint clears current view information. Accidental selection of viewpoint may result into users loss on current scene information. This will prompt user before applying the new viewpoint to scene. This helps user to avoid current view information loss.

Auto Backup                       This option helps user to have a back up of viewpoints during creating or updating viewpoints. If user forgets to save viewpoints into cax, user can retrieve the viewpoints created using this option. A vpt file with cax file name will be created and updated. File will be available in %VCOLLAB_TEMP%\VCollab.

Apply View                        Skips applying view/orientation if this flag is unchecked. Flag is checked by default.

Add Visible Label Viewpoint...    This is applicable only if the selected viewpoint contains CAE probed labels. In the selected viewpoint, labels of which attached positions are not visible in the current view are suppressed. And the suppressed labels are taken to new viewpoint. User has to provide viewpoint name.

                                   - This option is to interactively modify/split a viewpoint in such a way that multiple viewpoints can be created with visible hotspots.
                                   - User selects a viewpoint. Then changes the view by using rotate / zoom / section options such that a set of hotspot labels are visible.
                                   - Then user selects 'Add Visible Label ViewPoint' option. The system will create a new viewpoint with only visible hotspots in this modified view.
                                   - The remaining hotspots will remain in the original viewpoint.
                                   - By repeating these steps user can create multiple viewpoints without missing any hotspot.

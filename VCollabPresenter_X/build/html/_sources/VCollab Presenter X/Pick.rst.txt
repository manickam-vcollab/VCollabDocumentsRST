Pick
======

This command helps user to interact with each individual part alone   
in assembly of parts or a product.                                    
                                                                          
    User can,                                                             
                                                                          
    -  Pick a part(s)                                                       
    -  transform the picked part(s),                                      
                                                                          
    Once a part is picked by this command, mouse mode transformation is   
    made applicable to the selected parts until 'Pick' is disabled.    
    Once 'Pick' option is disabled, mouse mode transformation is made     
    available back to camera (viewer).

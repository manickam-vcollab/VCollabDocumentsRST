Extrema are the extreme values of a function - the places where it
reaches its minimum and maximum values. There are two types of extrema -
local and global. Global extrema are the largest and smallest values
that a function takes on over its entire domain, and local extrema are
extrema which occur in a specific neighborhood of the function. In both
the local and global cases, it is important to be cognizant of the
domain over which the function is defined. That which is an extremum on
one domain may very well not be over a new domain, and vice versa.

 Local Extrema

 Mathematically, the local extrema for a field *f*\ (*x*, *y*, *z*) are
 defined as follows.

Local maximum: *f'* = 0 and *f''* < 0

Local minimum: *f'* = 0 and *f''* > 0

In a continuous field, a hill top represents a local maximum and a
valley bottom represents a local minimum. This is true even in a
discrete fields with no discontinuities provided the discrete field
assuming that extrema are happening only the at the specified discrete
points.The standard way to search for local maxima/minima in a discrete
field is to look for all points whose values are more/less than all its
neighbors.

 Global Extrema

 Global extrema are maximum and minimum in the whole domain independent
 of neighborhood. There will be only one set of extrema for the whole
 domain.

 Consider the following graph. Let us fin the local and global extrema.

 Steps to find Local Extrema

1. Compute all the local minima/maxima for the whole field. As
   mentioned earlier, we only need to look for nodes whose values are
   higher/lower than their neighbors. Using this methodology,
   considering the field displayed in the curve in Fig. 3, we can obtain
   the local extrema as given below:
   Local maxima: Nodes *a*, *c*, *e*, *g*, *i* and *k*
   Local minima: Nodes *b*, *d*, *f*, *h* and *j*
2. Sort the nodes (extrema) such that the result values are in
   descending order. For this case, the order can be obtained as *g*,
   *e*, *i*, *a*, *h*, *c*, *d*, *f*, *k*, *j* and *b*

3. Pick the top m nodes and bottom n nodes and highlight them to the
   user. In this case, if user asks for 3 top and 2 bottom, we
   highlight nodes *g*, *e* and *i* (maxima) and *b* and *j* (minima).

4. If user sets a range, the nodes that lie outside the range are
   filtered out. For example, when a range (f\ :sub:`min`\ ,
   f\ :sub:`max`\ ) is used, we highlight *a*, *c* and *k* (maxima) and
   *f* and *d* (minima).

 Steps to find Global Extrema

1. Arrange all values in descending order. For this case, the order can
   be obtained as g,e,i,a,h,c,d,f,k,j and b
2. Pick the top m nodes and bottom n nodes and highlight them to the
   user. In this case, if user asks for 3 top and 2 bottom, we highlight
   nodes, g,e,i (top) and b,j (bottom).
3. If user sets a range, the nodes that lie outside the range are
   filtered out. For example, when a range (f\ :sub:`min`\ ,
   f\ :sub:`max`\ ) is used, we highlight a, h, c (top) and f,k
   (bottom).

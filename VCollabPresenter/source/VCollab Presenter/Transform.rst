Navigator
=========

The **Navigator** option allows users to transform the model in passive
mode.

The GUI for Navigator is enabled in the viewer by default. Moving the
mouse pointer to the right side of the viewer makes the dynamic GUI
visible.

Events are highlighted during mouse over at the corresponding event
zones.

Enable Image Mode
==================

VCollab Control embedded powerpoint slides take significant time to
load. The Enable Image Mode is a useful option to avoid loading the
heavy .cax file by default while using MS Office Products. For e.g., if
the user saves the ppt when the presenter is in Image Mode, next time
while opening it will not load the linked .cax data automatically. The
user has the option to load the 3D model when needed. Thus presentation
slides can load quickly using the Image mode option.

**Steps to use the Enable Image Mode feature**

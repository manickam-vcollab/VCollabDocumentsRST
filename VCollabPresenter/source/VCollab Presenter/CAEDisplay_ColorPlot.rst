Display Color Plot
===================

The Color plot option in the Display sub menu lets users toggle between
Apply and Remove Contour / Color plot information in the viewer.

While this option removes contour information from the model, Legend
Information too is hidden.

Below is the image after removing the contour or color plot from the
model.

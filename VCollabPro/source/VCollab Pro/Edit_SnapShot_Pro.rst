=================
VCollab Pro stores user defined views and named views into a list. VCollab Pro uses this list to redo and undo operations.

There are three operations possible:

#. Click **Edit|SnapShot** to push or add a view into the view array. The last view that is pushed 
   becomes the current view in the array. (Shortcut key - 'Ctrl + W')

Generating Hotspot ViewPath 
============================
                          
VCollab Pro uses the concept of viewpoints to store a display   
state and makes it available for retrieval at a later time. A   
sequence of view points is termed as a viewpath in VCollab Pro. 
The automatic hotspot generator in VCollab Pro generates the    
hotspots as a view path. Each viewpoint in a view path can      
display annotated hotspots over a zone of the mesh or over the  
whole geometry.                                                
                                                               
**Steps to generate hotspots automatically**  
                                                                                 
 1. Load a model, select the desired result (determines the    
    hotspots) in the CAE results.                           
                                                                
 2. Click **CAE Settings \| Hotspot Finder** to open the Hotspot
    settings dialog box                                      
                                                               
 3. Select Hotspots options as per requirement. For             
    understanding Hotspot Finder options click here.        
                                                               
 4. Make sure that '**Add Viewpoints**' option is enabled to   
    generate viewpoints. VCollab Pro adds a new path with the
    given name (say, “Strain Energy HotSpots” ) and switches  
    the active view path to the new one. Users can click on  
    different viewpoints and see the hotspots and            
    annotations. The hotspots that are generated by this     
    procedure can be saved into viewpoints for future use.    
                                                                 
**Steps to edit the generated viewpoint manually**             
                                                                
 1. Create viewpath by generating hotspot as explained above.   
                                                            
 2. Open **Probe Settings|Label Settings** and check **Keep**  
    **Previous Labels** option under **Others** tab          
                                                                
 3. Select a viewpoint generated previously, for example    
    viewpoint “Object 1”                                     
                                                                
 4. Go to **Tools -> Labels/Notes -> Delete Labels/Notes** to   
    remove unwanted annotations and **Tools -> Labels/Notes 
    -> Move Labels/Notes** to move the annotations           
                                                                
 5. Uncheck the **Tools -> Labels/Notes -> Delete Labels/Notes**
    when completed                                           
                                                                 
 6. Click the **Hotspot Finder** icon.                                                                                          
 7. Drag and select an area to create hotspots in that area.     
                                                                
 8. Right click on the viewpoint to be edited from the ViewPoint
    tab and select **Update ViewPoint**.                      
                                                                
 **Generating hotspots manually using global extrema**           
                                                                 
The hotspots generated automatically may not serve the user     
requirement every time. In VCollab Pro users can delete or add  
to the automatically generated hotspots. However, for manual    
hotspot generation only nodes with global extrema values        
(minimum/maximum) are supported. [STRIKEOUT:Local extrema nodes
are not supported at present.]                                  
                                                                 
**Steps to find hotspots manually**                             
                                                                 
 #. Click hotspot finder icon\ |image1| in the toolbar. The    
    mouse mode is now changed to hotspot finder mode.         
                                                                
 #. Click and drag on the graphics window to select a region as  
    shown in the image below.                                 
                                                             
                                                                 
    |image2|                                                    
                                                                 
Once a region is selected, VCollab Pro locates the nodes with   
minimum and maximum values in the selected region and displays  
them as shown below.                                           
                                                                 
    |image3|      
                                              
#. The above picture shows two hotspots (node 25 and node 96)  
   that are identified by VCollab Pro. The maximum          
   deformation (displacement) in the selected rectangular    
   window occurs at node 25 (magnitude of 1.866) and the     
   minimum occurs at node 96 (magnitude of 0.016).          
                                                                 
#. The user can select another region and display the nodes    
   with minimum and maximum values. The number of hotspots  
   along with other settings can be changed in **Hotspot  
   Finder settings** dialog. This dialog can be opened using
   the following steps.                                      
                                                                 
    #. Invoke **CAE settings** dialog by clicking on the menu   
       item **CAE -> CAE Settings.**                         
                                                                 
    #. Click on the **Hotspot finder** tab.                     
                                                               
    #. This opens the dialog with hotspot finder settings. The 
       available settings is shown in the following          
       screenshot.                                            
                                                               
    #. Select Min/Max option in 'Find' drop down list.          
                                                             
                                                                
    |image4|                                                  
                                                                
         #. All default settings except All Top and Bottom, are the same
            as in Hotspots option.                                   
                                                                
#. The following list explains different settings and their    
   significance.    
                                        
       #. The number of hot spots to be displayed can be controlled
          by changing the values in top and bottom text boxes.  
          In the following figure, two top and three bottom hot
          spots are specified.                                  
                                                                
    |image5|    
                                              
 #. Selecting an area on the screen with the left mouse down     
    with these settings, results in the display of five hot   
    spots (two nodes with highest values and three nodes with
    the lowest values). Users can uncheck the top/bottom or  
    change its count to zero to display only the nodes with   
    the lowest/highest values respectively.                  
                                                                
 #. The Zone radius option that is provided in the hot spot      
    settings allows the user to avoid locating hot spots next 
    to each other.                                            
                                                             
     |image6| 
                                                            
    Once a node with maximum/minimum is found, VCollab skips all 
    the nodes within the specified radius of that node during    
    its search for the next maximum/minimum. The following two   
    images show the identified hotspots without and with the use
    of **zone radius** option.                                  
                                                               
     |image7|                                                   
                                                                
     |image8|                                                  
                                                                
    Note: When the mouse control is in hotspot mode, users      
    cannot zoom, pan or rotate the image. To be able to do so,  
    while continuing in hotspot mode, users can turn on the      
    **Navigator** by either turning on the Navigator in the      
    product tree or by clicking the menu item **T\ ools ->       
    Navigator**. The navigator displays additional entities on  
    the graphical window which facilitate zoom, rotate of pan    
    the scene.

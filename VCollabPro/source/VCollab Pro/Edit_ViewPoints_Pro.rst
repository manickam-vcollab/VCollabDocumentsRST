View Point List
***************
In VCollab Pro, users can define and create different viewpoints (.vpt files)  for different types of views on a given model. These views can be retrieved through  viewpoint states. A viewpoint story can also be built which can be exported into a PPT file. Creating these animated paths or walk-through models helps users to gain better insights on a model.

The first user defined viewpoint is the default viewpoint that is seen when the model is loaded. When a user exports the viewpoints to a VPT file, all the existing viewpoints are saved in it. 

A view point state may contain

- Notes
- Annotation
- Display mode
- Probed CAE result labels
- Pick and move part state
- Exploded view
- Measurements
- Cut section
- CAE result information.
- Merged models view.
- Background Mode and Image.

.. note::
	Standard Views
	   - These viewpoints are not stored in a CAX file.
	   - All standard views are generated by default.
	   - Users can add and update viewpoints using the Capture Camera option in the context menu.
	   - Only viewing position and orientation are saved. Other states are not saved.
	   - These viewpoints can be saved through profile and cannot be saved in CAX file.

                                  supported python scripts to run
 
 **Export ViewPoints**            This option helps users to export 
 
                                   - All viewpoints as images into a PPT(\*.ppt) file.
                                   - All viewpoints in a VPT (\*.vpt) file.
                                   - Filtered parts and results into a new CAX (\*.cax) file.
 								  
                                        - Parts or Geometry and Results available 
                                          across all viewpoints will be saved into CAX.
                                        - Other parts and results will not be saved.
 
 **AddVisibleLabelViewPt...**   This option is applicable only if the selected viewpoint contains 
                                CAE  probed labels. In the selected viewpoint, labels of attached 
                                positions that are not visible in the current view are suppressed. 
                                The suppressed labels are taken to a new viewpoint during hotspot 
                                generation. 
 
                                  - This option is used to modify/split a viewpoint 
                                    in such a way that multiple viewpoints can be 
                                    created with visible hotspots.
                                  - Users need to select a viewpoint and change the 
                                    view by using rotate / zoom / section options 
                                    such that a set of hotspot labels are visible.
                                  - Thereafter, 'Add Visible Label ViewPoint' option  
                                    helps to create a new viewpoint with only 
                                    visible hotspots in this modified view. The 
                                    remaining hotspots will remain in the original viewpoint.
                                  - By repeating these steps users can create 
                                    multiple viewpoints without missing any 
                                    hotspot.
 
 **Edit Mode**                   Selecting a viewpoint clears current view information. 
                                 Accidental selection of viewpoint may result in loss of current 
                                 scene information. To avoid this the user will be prompted 
                                 before the new viewpoint is applied.
 
 **Auto Backup**                 This option helps to take backup of viewpoints during creating 
                                 or updating viewpoints. If the user forgets to save viewpoints 
                                 into CAX, he can retrieve the viewpoints created using this 
                                 option. A VPT file with CAX file name will be created and 
                                 updated. This file will be saved in **%VCOLLAB_TEMP%\VCollab.**

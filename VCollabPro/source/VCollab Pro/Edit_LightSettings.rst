Light Settings
===============

VCollab Pro lets users alter light settings for  better visualization, especially inside the 
parts.

There are two types of lights whose settings can be altered for better viewing:

1. **Head Light**

 - This light is attached to the camera. Light direction is updated automatically whenever camera 
   direction changes.
 -  Users can turn on/off this light, but cannot edit the light direction. 

2. **Direction Lights**

 - There are three direction lights with three mutually perpendicular directions which are 
   switched off by default.
 - Users can turn on/off these lights and can edit each light direction.
 - Users can attach these lights to the camera or remove them from the camera.
 - Users can vary the light intensity from least bright to most bright.

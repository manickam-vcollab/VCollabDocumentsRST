Symbol Plot
==============

VCollab Pro users can add and display symbols at selected locations on
the CAE model for **Vector** results , **Tensor** results, SPC and
Pressure using the **Symbol Plot** option. The symbols can be displayed
either in 2D or 3D as shown below

SPC (Single Point Constraint)
*****************************

 This function creates multiple symbol plots based on the constraint
 type. It groups nodes or elements based on constraint type the node or
 element has. Then it creates a symbol plot with the name "Constraint
 Type_T[xyz]_R[xyz]".
 
 There are 63 combinations of Translational and Rotational constraints.
 
 For example,
 
 T[x]_R[z] - "Translation is fixed only in X direction and Rotation is
 fixed only in Z direction".
 
 T[xyz] - "No Translation in all 3 degrees of freedom".
 
 R[xyz] - "No Rotation in all 3 degrees of freedom".
 
 T[xyz]_R[xyz] - "Completely constrained in all 6 degrees of freedom".

**Steps to create a Symbol Plot**

-  Click **CAE \| Symbol Plot..** to open the dialog as shown below

   |image15|


 -  Select a CAE model name from the drop down list.                  
                                                                      
 -  Select a Plot Type from the drop down list, which lists valid     
    plot types based on the CAE model results.                     
                                                                      
 -  Symbol Direction Definition:                                    
    CAE Result data is required for symbol direction. Result     
    Information will be updated based on the plot type selected.

 -   Symbol Position Definition: Users can skip this if the plot     
     type is of SPC or Pressure, in which case they can click the 
     **Create** button directly without defining symbol           
     positions.                                                   
     In other cases, symbol positions are defined by Nodes. There 
     are various options to select nodes,                         
                                                                      
    -  Enable **Pick** option and click on the model to select nodes.

   Nodes text box will be appended with nodes after each selection.

-  Enable **Rect** option to select nodes by region or window in the
   viewer.

 **Steps to scale, change color and dimension of the symbols**
                                                                      
 -  Define plot type, results and positions.                          
                                                                      
 -  Click **Create**, which applies and displays the symbols.         

    |image18|


 -  Click the **Options** button, which opens up symbol plot options  
    dialog. This UI allows user to control length/height, width    
    and color of symbols.                                          
                                                                                                                                         
                                                                      
    The following image displays the symbols after modifying the      
    symbol size and color.                                            

    |image19|


 -  Users can change the symbols into 2D. Select symbol type as 2D    
    Symbol.                                                       

    |image20|

    Users can select different view modes, only for Vector Type symbols in options dialog.

 -  View mode: **Auto** is default one, which makes all symbols visible
    on the outer surface of the model.

    |image21|

    View mode : **From Position** makes all symbols start from vertices.

    |image22|

    View mode : **To Position** makes all vector symbols end at vertices.

    |image23|

    View mode : **Resultant** computes a single symbol by averaging all symbols and displays the resultant.

    |image24|

Users can create multiple plots in a single CAE model and classify them
with color and size.

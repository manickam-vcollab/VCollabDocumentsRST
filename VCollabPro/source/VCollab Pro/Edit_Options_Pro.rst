The various options and fields seen in the **Options** panel are explained below

===================================== ===========================================================
 **Animate Zoom**                      For smooth transformation while doing  Rubber band zoom.

 **Probe on Mouse Move**               To probe values on mouse over geometry. By default values 
                                       are  probed on left click of the mouse.

 **Start Animation**                   Starts animation at the time of  launching the CAE 
                                       Animation  Control.If it is unchecked, users have
                                       to click **Play** to start animation.

**Update Normals On CAE Animation**    Updates Normals of model during CAE Animation.

**Use File Name as Model Name**        CAX file name can be used as root model node name. 
                                       **Note:** This option will be ignored if the CAX file name 
                                       is of Unicode characters. It will work for ASCII 
                                       characters.

**Use Shader**                         Shader programming is supported in this application for 
                                       better performance. To toggle shader, VCollab recommends
                                       to close and reopen the application.

**Inverse Flat Normals**               In some old graphics cards, during CAE Animation,Model will 
                                       be rendered in black color.This happens when Update Normal 
                                       in CAE Animation is enabled.This option resolves this 
                                       issue.  

**Transparency**                       Allows users to edit Display Mode transparency value 
                                       percentage.Default Value is 93%. 0% refers to No- 
                                       transparency. 100% refers to Full transparency (Invisible)

**Line Size**                          Updates the geometry line set size.

**Point Size**                         Updates the geometry point set size.

**Image Position in Powerpoint**       Allows users to position the image and change the size in 
                                       powerpoint slide.

**Auto**                               Positions the image with default options.

                                       pixel.
**Origin**                             Allows users to modify the position of the image.

**Size**                               Allows users to modify the width and height of the image

**Use Plain Background in PPT**        Sets plain background before generating images for ppt.

**Gif Animation**                      Captures animation frames into GIF format, which can be 
                                       inserted into PPT.

**Set Working Directory**              The directory from which the cax file was loaded is the  
                                       default working directory. The working directory can be  
                                       edited and set by the user. All file dialogs will pop
                                       with the setworking directory.

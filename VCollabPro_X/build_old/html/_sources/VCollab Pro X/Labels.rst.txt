    #. User Notes                                        
                                                                          
       -  Annotation to Geometry:                                         
                                                                          
          These labels are created by user as an observation which is     
          annotated to a particular part or element or node. A line       
          connects the label and geometry. Labels are moving according to 
          part or view transformation.    
          Image Labels have text as well as image data.
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                          
       -  Annotation to Scene:                                            
                                                                          
          These labels are created by user as an observation which is     
          annotated to the current view or scene. Labels are fixed in     
          screen either by absolute or relative to the viewport size.     
          Absolute position labels will be clipped if viewport is resized 
          down.

This function is applicable for CAE Probe labels only. All labels     
will be arranged based on the user selected algorithm or mode.

       Aligns Labels' bottom left corner positions with probed vertices.  
       **Overlapping** is unavoidable here.

VCollab Pro helps user to create annotation table with multiple rows, 
column and a header.

================================== ===============================================================================================

Attach Geometry                     Allows user to attach this table to a point on the model.

Behind Scene                        Allows user to set the 2D image behind the model. This option is ignored if Attach Geometry is ON.

Relative Position / Use Node ID     When **Attach Geometry** is checked, then **Relative Position** check is turned into **Use Node ID**. 
                                    **Relative Position** stores position of table relative to window and changes accordingly with window resize.
                                    **Use Node ID** allows user to enter node id in the Node ID text box, instead of picking node id in viewport.

Model                               Displays model name if **Use Node ID** is enabled. 

Part                                Displays Part Name if  Use Node ID is enabled.

Node ID                             Enables if  **Use Node ID**  is enabled and allows user to enter node ID to be attached with.

Rows, Columns                       Allows user to define table rows and columns size.

**How to add tables?**
                                      
                                                                          
    -  Click the dropdown menu located at the end of Labels tool bar.     
    -  Click Add Table option to pop up Add Table dialog box.    
    
       |image26|                                                  
    -  Define the number of rows and columns using given interfaces.      
    -  Double click the cell to edit the contents. For example,  
    
       |image27|

    -  **Relative Position** and **Attach Geometry** options functions    
       same way as in the Add Notes annotations.                          
    -  Enabling Attach Geometry option displays Use Node ID options.      
    -  It helps user to enter model, part and node ID to be attached      
       with.   
       
       |image29|                                           
    -  To edit a table, double click on the specific table.               
    -  It drops down Table context menu   
    
       |image30|
